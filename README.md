# Syntax Highlighter
This Go program is a syntax highlighter of the Python programming language.

- Reads multiple `.txt` files and generates their corresponding HTML files whose Python code is highlighted through CSS.
- The program executes this process in two different ways: in parallel and sequentially; in order to evaluate both.
- The main functionality of the program is based on a Deterministic Finite Automaton whose states are fixed to the Python programming language.
